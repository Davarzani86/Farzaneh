<b>Description:</b> <br>


Hi!<br>
I am currently an advanced researcher serving as a postdoctoral fellow in a joint program with [Sara Allin](https://ihpme.utoronto.ca/faculty-profile/sara-allin/) at the University of Toronto's School of Public Health and [Mehdi Ammi](https://carleton.ca/sppa/mehdi-ammi-2/) under their CIHR grant on "Public Health Finance". In this capacity, I am deeply engaged in conducting advanced research in the field of public health finance. My focus lies in addressing critical issues and exploring innovative solutions to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of public health financing mechanisms. <br>
I received my PhD in Economics at the University of Ottawa under supervision of [Lilia Karnizova](https://uniweb.uottawa.ca/?lang=fr#!/members/914) and <br> 
[Raul Razo-Garcia](https://sites.google.com/site/razogarciahomepage/). <br>


<b>Research interests:</b> <br>

I am a macroeconomist with a specialization in quantitative econometrics. My expertise is in international economics, public health, and applied econometrics.
