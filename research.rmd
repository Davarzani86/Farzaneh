 <font size="3">[<b>The Impact of Income Inequality on Domestic Investment in Resource-Rich Countries </b>](1stPaper.pdf)</font> <br>


<div style="text-align: justify">This paper examines a relation between income inequality, natural-resource rents and domestic investment in resource-rich countries. While previous studies have found that the unequal distribution of natural-resource rents has a negative impact on general economic performance, little is known about its direct implications for domestic investment. In this paper, I apply difference and system generalized method-of-moments (GMM) estimators to a dynamic panel of 57 resource-rich countries, for the period from 1982 to 2015. My findings show that, on average, countries with higher income inequality contribute relatively lower proportions of their natural-resource rents to domestic investment than do countries with lower income inequality. This result is robust to a variety of income-inequality measures, estimation approaches, and alternative specifications. The results could help resource-rich countries in their efforts to achieve higher growth using their resource endowments.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">
We evaluate the importance of world shocks for explaining domestic inflation fluctuations. To this end, we devise a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model, in which world shocks affect domestic economies through changes in commodity prices and the world interest rate. The model is applied to a set of 105 countries, for the period from 1970 to 2015. Our results indicate that world shocks can explain twenty five percent of the inflation variance in the median country. Our results also highlight the need for using multiple commodity price indices in assessing the effects of world shocks. The shares of world shocks in the variance of inflation have also been increased by 15% due to including the interest rate as an additional transmission channel. One-world-price SVAR models have been previously found to significantly underestimate the importance of world shocks for domestic business cycles. Similarly, we find that a fraction of the inflation variance explained by world shocks falls by more than half (below ten percent in the median country) when a single world price is included in the SVAR. Our results are robust to a range of alternative specifications. We also evaluate the role of structural country-specific characteristics in propagation of global shocks.

<font size="3">[<b>Global Factors And Their Impact on Output Gap</b>]()</font> <br>

[Draft available upon request] <br>

<div style="text-align: justify">
We study the importance of global factors for explaining output gap and output trend. To this end, we devise a factor augmented vector autoregressive (FAVAR) model, in which global factors affect potential output and output gap through changes in commodity prices and the other global factors. In our paper, we study the role of foreign shocks in driving the output trend and the cycle of the output given a large set of data. The empirical model is applied to 7 developed and 21 emerging economies, over the period from 1980Q1 to 2018Q4. Our empirical strategy provides an account of the role of foreign and domestic shocks in driving the output gap.
