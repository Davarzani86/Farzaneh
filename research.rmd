 <font size="3">[<b>Do Commodity Price Shocks matter for Estimating the Output Gap? </b>](3rdPaper.pdf)</font> <br>

<div style="text-align: justify">
This paper evaluates the importance of commodity price shocks to estimate the output gap using Beveridge and Nelson decomposition method. To do so, I compute the share of domestic and foreign shocks in the variance decomposition of the output gap. I devise a VAR model, in which world shocks affect the output trend and the output gap through changes in commodity prices and global economic factors. I report the results for 7 advanced and 20 emerging economies, over the 1980 -- 2018 period. My results suggest that foreign shocks appear to be more important for the output gap, relative to the output trend and the emerging economies' output trends appear to be more affected by foreign shocks relative to advanced economies. Also, commodity price shocks account for much of the reported shares of foreign shocks in the output trend for both economies. I also assess the reliability of estimated output gaps in predicting inflation in comparison to other output measures. I find that output gap estimates relatively do better in inflation forecasting compared to other specifications. This result highlights the need for using commodity price indices in assessing the effects of world shocks to estimate the output gap.

<div style="text-align: justify">
We evaluate the importance of world shocks for explaining domestic inflation fluctuations. To this end, using a factor model we extract the co-movements of commodity prices to proxy for world prices. Then, we devise a structural vector autoregressive model, in which world shocks affect domestic economies through changes in common factors of commodity prices and the world interest rate. The model is applied to a set of 67 advanced and emerging countries, for the period from 1970 to 2014. Our results indicate that world shocks can explain between twenty six and thirty seven percent of inflation fluctuations in the median country. We evaluate the role of world shocks on inflation fluctuation while controlling for different country-specific indicators. Our results highlight the need for using the co-movement of commodity prices in assessing the effects of world shocks. Single-world-price vector autoregression models have been previously found to significantly underestimate the importance of world shocks for domestic business cycles. Similarly, we find that a fraction of the inflation variance explained by world shocks falls by more than half (below thirteen percent in the median country) when a single-world-price is included in the model. Finally, our results are robust to a range of alternative specifications.

 <font size="3">[<b>The Impact of Income Inequality on Domestic Investment in Resource-Rich Countries </b>](1stPaper.pdf)</font> <br>

<div style="text-align: justify">This paper examines a relation between income inequality, natural-resource rents and domestic investment in resource-rich countries. While previous studies have found that the unequal distribution of natural-resource rents has a negative impact on general economic performance, little is known about its direct implications for domestic investment. In this paper, I apply difference and system generalized method-of-moments (GMM) estimators to a dynamic panel of 57 resource-rich countries, for the period from 1982 to 2015. My findings show that, on average, countries with higher income inequality contribute relatively lower proportions of their natural-resource rents to domestic investment than do countries with lower income inequality. This result is robust to a variety of income-inequality measures, estimation approaches, and alternative specifications. The results could help resource-rich countries in their efforts to achieve higher growth using their resource endowments.</div>
