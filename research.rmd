<font size="3">[<b>On the Long-Run Association Between Preventive Care Spending and Mortality</b>](2ndPaper.pdf)</font> <br>

<div style="text-align: justify">
Evidence from OECD Countries, 1970-2020}\\ This study examines the long-term relationship between preventive care spending and mortality rates across 37 OECD countries from 1970 to 2019. Using dynamic common correlated effects (DCCE) panel error correction modeling, it finds a modest long-run preventive care spending elasticity of -0.10, indicating reduced mortality. Higher preventive spending correlates with decreased infant mortality and fewer daily smokers, contributing to increased life expectancy.

<font size="3">[<b>Qualitative Study to Categorize Public Health Expenditure Items in Canada</b>](2ndPaper.pdf)</font> <br>

<div style="text-align: justify">
This comprehensive study delves into the qualitative analysis of public health expenditures across various jurisdictions in Canada. Utilizing data from the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI), we investigate the components of public health expenditures. Our methodology involves employing focus group discussions to explore differences in categorizing public health spending across different government levels and international contexts.

<font size="3">[<b>World Shocks, Commodity Prices and Domestic Inflation</b>](2ndPaper.pdf)</font> <br>

<div style="text-align: justify">
This research investigates the impact of global commodity price shocks on domestic inflation. Using factor models and structural vector autoregressive models with data from 67 countries (1970-2014), this paper uncovers that world shocks significantly influence inflation fluctuations in the median country. Furthermore, this paper emphasizes the necessity of incorporating commodity price factors in assessing the effects of world shocks on domestic inflation, as single-world-price models tend to underestimate their role in domestic business cycles.

 <font size="3">[<b>Do Commodity Price Shocks matter for Estimating the Output Gap? </b>](3rdPaper.pdf)</font> <br>

<div style="text-align: justify">
In this research, I investigate the significance of commodity price shocks in estimating the output gap. Utilizing the Beveridge and Nelson decomposition method and a VAR model with data from advanced and emerging economies (1980-2018), I find that foreign shocks play a substantial role in influencing the output gap compared to the output trend. Additionally, I emphasize the significant contribution of commodity price shocks to the foreign shocks' influence on the output trend and the importance of incorporating commodity price indices in analyzing the effects of world shocks on the output gap. 


 <font size="3">[<b>The Impact of Income Inequality on Domestic Investment in Resource-Rich Countries </b>](1stPaper.pdf)</font> <br>

<div style="text-align: justify">

This study explores the relationship between income inequality, natural-resource rents, and domestic investment in resource-rich countries. Employing difference and system-generalized method-of-moments estimators with data from 57 resource-rich countries (1982-2015), This paper finds that countries with higher income inequality allocate a relatively smaller proportion of natural-resource rents to domestic investment. The results hold robust across various income-inequality measures, estimation methods, and specifications, providing implications for resource-rich countries aiming for higher economic growth through effective resource utilization.
